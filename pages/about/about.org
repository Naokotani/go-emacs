* About Me
I am a software developer based in Portland, Oregon. My focus is on full-stack web development, with experience in server administration, cloud infrastructure, and API design. I work with a range of programming languages including Python, Go, TypeScript, Ruby, and Kotlin. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and tools to stay current with evolving technologies and to choose the best solution for each project. For more information and examples of my work, feel free to check out my GitHub.
