      I am a software developer specializing in Haskell web development. Based in Anywhere, World, I focus on building
      high-performance, type-safe web applications and APIs. I have experience with full-stack development, functional
      programming, database integration, and deploying scalable services. I work primarily with Haskell, but Iâ€™m also
      familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and tools to stay current with
      evolving technologies and to choose the best solution for each project. For examples of my work and contributions,
      feel free to check out my GitHub.
