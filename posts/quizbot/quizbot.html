  Quizbot is a task management bot written with <a href="https://discord.js.org/">discord.js</a> that is designed to be
  used for students or discords that are devoted to a university or college program. The bot allows users to interact
  with four commands, one of which is restricted to server admins.

<div id="outline-container-org3b45d7c" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="org3b45d7c">Class</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3b45d7c">
    <p>
      Class is the admin only command. It allows users to create, add, remove and change the status of classes by using
      interactive commands. Because the tasks tables have a foreign key relationship dependency on the class table a
      class can only be removed if all of the tasks for that class have been removed. To solve this problem I decided to
      make a column in the class table that determines whether or not the class is "active" or "inactive" and if the
      class inactive, then no tasks will appear for that class when a user shows tasks. Once all tasks that use the
      classes primary key as their foreign key are removed, you are free to remove the class. By default, classes are
      set to be active when they are created.

  <h2 id="org3c3a9c0">Task</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3c3a9c0">
    <p>
      The task command is how users create the tasks themselves. Using the task gives the user a prompt with select
      style menus with available classes and provides fields to add the date for the task. After entering this data a
      modal allows for confirmation of the task and gives an opportunity enter additional longer form information and
      set the time.

  <h2 id="org14f9143">Next and Show</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org14f9143">
    <p>
      The next and show commands are how users display the tasks. I decided to make these commands ephemeral to reduce
      spam in the server, while the task command is not ephemeral to make it less likely for people to try to enter the
      same task multiple times.

  <h2 id="org0d634c9">Why SQLite?</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0d634c9">
    <p>
      I decided to use SQLite for this project mainly for the sake of simplicity. For personal use it would just as easy
      to use, for example, a PostgreSQL, but if I wanted to make the bot available for others to use SQLite has the
      advantage of being much easier for users to install use as it can set itself up without any need for extra input
      from the user. In this case simplicity seemed more important than scalability or efficiency of the database.

  <h2 id="org74c8694">What's Next?</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org74c8694">
    <p>
      I designed this bot so that it could be made available for others to use, but as it stands it is not robust enough
      to be made available for others to use.

    <h3 id="orgd9c2899">Database Maintenance</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd9c2899">
      <p>
        For one thing, there is currently no good way to delete classes or tasks. Tasks need to be manually deleted and
        deleting classes requires users to delete all tasks associated with a class. This would be incredibly cumbersome
        for normal users. I would like to implement a solution that is a scheduled task that, perhaps once a day and
        when the app starts, will check for classes that have no associated tasks and were created more than a several
        months ago (perhaps four months or around the length of a normal semester). Furthermore, tasks whose due date
        has past by more than perhaps two weeks will automatically be deleted. This way, the database should
        automatically clean itself without getting in the way too much by deleting things in a way that isn't expected.
        It would probably be good to create a way for admins to change these values from the defaults.

    <h3 id="org4e2641a">Validation</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e2641a">
      <p>
        The other place the bot needs improvement is validation and testing. It made some effort to validate data, but
        more effort is required here. I am considering rewriting the bot in typescript to ensure that the data being
        sent to the database is in the correct type in order to prevent data inconsistency. I would also like to do more
        work on testing and using TypeScript would reduce the complexity of the tests I would need to write by
        elimination errors from inconsistencies in types.
