<p>
I am a software developer specializing in Haskell web development. Based in Anywhere, World, I focus on building high-performance, type-safe web applications and APIs. I have experience with full-stack development, functional programming, database integration, and deploying scalable services. I work primarily with Haskell, but Iâ€™m also familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and tools to stay current with evolving technologies and to choose the best solution for each project. For examples of my work and contributions, feel free to check out my GitHub.
